### 2. Player Conduct

2.1. **Roleplay and Immersion Requirements**: To maintain a consistent and immersive environment, players must adhere to the following roleplay standards:
- Stay in character at all times. Out-of-character (OOC) communication should only be used in designated channels or in emergencies where it is absolutely necessary.
- Respect other players' roleplay experiences and avoid actions that would disrupt immersion, such as blatantly breaking character or engaging in unrealistic behavior.

2.2. **Respect and Fair Play**: All players are expected to maintain a respectful and cooperative environment.
- Harassment, discrimination, and toxicity will not be tolerated. This includes but is not limited to offensive language, griefing, or targeted harassment.
- Use of exploits or unintended game mechanics to gain an advantage is strictly prohibited. All exploits must be reported immediately.

2.3. **Player Freedom and Consequences**: While Sector 14 emphasizes player freedom, actions within the game may have in-character consequences.
- Players can participate in politics, lawmaking, corporate affairs, and other in-game systems. However, these actions must be carried out in line with established roleplay rules and server guidelines.
- Actions that result in significant disruption to the game or community (e.g., exploiting bugs for financial gain, griefing others) will be addressed by server moderation. Consequences may include character deletion, temporary bans, or permanent bans.

### 3. Permanent Saving and Data Policies

3.1. **Persistent World and Player Impact**: Sector 14 features a persistent universe where player actions have lasting effects. You acknowledge that:
- Player progress, including assets, relationships, and in-game decisions, is saved and carried over between sessions.
- Significant events in the game (e.g., political changes, major conflicts) may be recorded in the server's lore and continue to impact future gameplay.

3.2. **Data Wipes and Resets**: Due to the experimental nature of the server, it may be necessary to wipe all or part of the server's data. This can include:
- Character data, inventory, progression, and map data.
- Changes may be made with little or no notice. These resets are essential for implementing changes or addressing critical issues.

3.3. **Compensation Policy**: Sector 14 staff will handle "refund" requests with the following in mind:
- Lost items may be refunded if sufficient proof of ownership is provided, at Sector 14's staff discretion.
- Lost characters may be refunded if sufficient proof of ownership is provided, at Sector 14's staff discretion.
- Lost grids may be refunded if their data is still stored within the server backups (and sufficient proof of ownership is provided), at Sector 14's staff discretion.
- Sector 14 staff does not have the obligation to refund/restore any loss of progress caused by player action.
- Due to the alpha status, compensation for in-game losses resulting from bugs, wipes, or other unexpected events may not always be provided.
