  # 3. Permanent Saving and Data Policies
  3.1. [bold]Persistent World and Player Impact[/bold]: Sector 14 features a persistent universe where player actions have lasting effects. You acknowledge that:
  - Player progress, including assets, relationships, and in-game decisions, is saved and carried over between sessions.
  - Significant events in the game (e.g., political changes, major conflicts) may be recorded in the server's lore and continue to impact future gameplay.

  3.2. [bold]Data Wipes and Resets[/bold]: Due to the experimental nature of the server, it may be necessary to wipe all or part of the server's data. This can include:
  - Character data, inventory, progression, and map data.
  - Changes may be made with little or no notice. These resets are essential for implementing changes or addressing critical issues.

  3.3. [bold]Compensation Policy[/bold]: Sector 14 staff will handle "refund" requests with the following in mind:
  - Lost items may be refunded if sufficient proof of ownership is provided, to Sector 14's staff discretion.
  - Lost characters may be refunded if sufficient proof of ownership is provided, to Sector 14's staff discretion.
  - Lost grids may be refunded if their data is still stored within the server backups (and sufficient proof of ownership is provided) to Sector 14's staff discretion.
  - Sector 14 staff does not have the obligation to refund/restore any loss of progress caused by player action.
  - Due to the alpha status, compensation for in-game losses resulting from bugs, wipes, or other unexpected events may not always be provided.
