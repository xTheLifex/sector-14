  # 2. Acknowledgement of Experimental Status
  2.1. [bold]Roleplay and Immersion Requirements[/bold]: To maintain a consistent and immersive environment, players must adhere to the following roleplay standards:
  - Stay in character at all times. Out-of-character (OOC) communication should only be used in designated channels or in emergencies where it is absolutely necessary.
  - Respect other players' roleplay experiences and avoid actions that would disrupt immersion, such as blatantly breaking character or engaging in unrealistic behavior.

  2.2. [bold]Respect and Fair Play[/bold]: All players are expected to maintain a respectful and cooperative environment.
  - Harassment, discrimination, and toxicity will not be tolerated. This includes but is not limited to offensive language, griefing, or targeted harassment.
  - Use of exploits or unintended game mechanics to gain an advantage is strictly prohibited. All exploits must be reported immediately.

  2.3. [bold]Player Freedom and Consequences[/bold]: While Sector 14 emphasizes player freedom, actions within the game may have in-character consequences.
  - Players can participate in politics, lawmaking, corporate affairs, and other in-game systems. However, these actions must be carried out in line with established roleplay rules and server guidelines.
  - Actions that result in significant disruption to the game or community (e.g., exploiting bugs for financial gain, griefing others) will be addressed by server moderation. Consequences may include character deletion, temporary bans, or permanent bans.
